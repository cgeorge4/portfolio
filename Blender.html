        <!--VR Project-->
        <td>Created July 2024, I took inspiration from my experience
           at the Balloon Museum that came to visit Atlanta. I loved
           how during the VR experience the animations took the user
           on a journey and I wanted to create that on a smaller scale
           with what I had available to me. The big things I’ve learned
           from working on this project was 1. Lighting is a necessary
          evil and 2. Camera work is very tricky. This was my first
          project working more in depth with lighting that, for me,
           was the most challenging part of this project especially
          for the opening of the blue room. If I were to revisit
           it I would close the room off like I did the other
          rooms rather than leaving it open causing the lighting I did add
           to disperse to other places it’s not intended to. The next thing
           that was pretty tricky for me was the actual camera work, with
          this being the first time I was moving the camera more aggressively
          in a project which caused me to have to think differently on how I 
          needed the objects to look and not only how I wanted them to look since the 
          camera was consistently moving in one general direction.

        <!--TAP Project-->
        <td>Created 2024, while working on a team project in 
          TAP (Technologies Ambassadors Program) our team made 
          a handful of 3D projects and one of mine from the group 
          was this realistic eye. The concept was to show how detailed 
          blender can get while using the same techniques we used to 
          build our model for our workshop
